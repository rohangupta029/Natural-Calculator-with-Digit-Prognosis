# Natural-Calculator-with-Digit-Prognosis

   A Handy Calculator in which the user doesn't have to type the numbers, but instead only draw the number, and the machine will be able to fetch the correct number and perform the required arithmetic operations.

   The handwritten digit recognition is the ability of computers to recognize human handwritten digits. It is a hard task for the machine because handwritten digits are not perfect and can be made with many different flavors.

   Handwritten digit recognition is the solution to this problem which uses he image of a digit and recognizes the digit present in the image and since the written information has a high probability of being captured incorrectly on the system we need it on anyway.

   The MNIST handwritten digit classification problem is a standard data-set used in computer vision and deep learning. Although the data-set is effectively solved, it is used as the basis for learning and practicing how to evelop, evaluate, and use convolutional deep learning neural networks for image classification.
